#Network Canvas visualizer

Network Canvas is a very powerful research tool in the field of social networks. However, there are not many tools available to analyze this data, and no extant tools exist in python, until now.
This script goes into the various messy files that network canvas exports, and visualizes the social network as the participant entered it, and then saves the png.
I was first tasked to create this script so we could experiment with the features of Network Canvas, to see what might be useful, but we will also use this script for actualy research in the near future.
Currently, this repository is private, but seeing as this is the only tool for this data available in python, in the near future I want to polish the script some more and make it open to the public.
